/**
 * Dungeon Recorder: every particle that will actually exist, and every tracking emitter (the crit
 * and enchanted-hit bursts that follow an entity for a few ticks).
 *
 * add() is where every particle enters the engine, whether it came through the level (createParticle
 * calls it), a block breaking, or a mod constructing particles itself. The particle's constructor
 * has run by then, so its position, motion and lifetime are set.
 *
 * Optional (require = 0): if a target ever moves, the recorder only loses those rows.
