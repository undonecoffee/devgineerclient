/**
 * How good each boss sub split was, as a colour: six bands cut from the recorded F7 runs, gold for
 * a personal best, light gray for a filler step that never varies (docs/mechanics/sub-splits.md).
 *
 *     §2 dark green   §a green   §e yellow   §c red   §4 dark red   §0 black
 *
 * Every step is graded on the clock its own mechanics run on: the server's ticks, except the
 * terminal sections (players, so lag is part of it), which are graded on real time. (Maxor's
 * cooldown was 10 s of real time until Hypixel's boss update of 5 Oct 2026; now it is ticks too.)
 *
 * Nothing here touches Minecraft, so it tests headlessly.
