/**
 * Dungeon Recorder: a map's whole picture once the client has applied a map packet (`mapfull`).
 *
 * handleMapItemData first hops to the game thread (PacketUtils.ensureRunningOnSameThread throws on
 * the network thread before the method ends), so TAIL only runs on the game thread, with the patch
 * applied to the map. Optional (require = 0): if the target ever moves, the recorder only loses
 * this line; the packet line still has the patch.
