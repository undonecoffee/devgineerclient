/**
 * The end of a whole frame, for the Dungeon Recorder's opt-in frame thumbnails.
 *
 * <p>By the time {@code renderFrame} returns, the main render target holds the finished frame:
 * the world, every mod's world rendering, the HUD, the open screen and anything drawn over it
 * (that is what {@code blitToScreen} just showed). A thumbnail taken here is what you saw, which
 * a hook at the end of the world pass would not be. Optional: if the target ever moves, the
 * thumbnails simply stop and the game is unaffected.
