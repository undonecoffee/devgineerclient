/**
 * What happens inside the Watcher, Portal and boss splits beyond the named boss steps, each
 * moment filed under the split it actually happens in.
 *
 *  - The energy crystals are Maxor's: two spawn on the upper platforms (y 238) when he starts,
 *    get picked up ("X picked up an Energy Crystal!"), and reappear placed on the lower ones
 *    (y 224). Chat's "1/2 Energy Crystals are now active!" says 1/2 for both, so the placed
 *    crystal appearing is what counts, and whoever stands nearest it placed it.
 *  - Goldor dies on "[BOSS] Goldor: ....". "Necron, forgive me.", 50-54 ticks later since
 *    Hypixel's boss update (Oct 2026), ends his death animation.
 *  - Simon Says presses are its buttons turning powered; the nearest player pressed them.
 *
 * Not possible: who hit Goldor or Necron (hits arrive with no attacker), and Storm's crushers
 * (silent block movements with nobody attached). The hit *times* are here, uncredited.
