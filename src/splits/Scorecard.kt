/**
 * Scorecard splits: the whole run on one table. Each row is one of the normal splits — its total
 * first, then the sub splits that make it up — each on whichever clock tells you more about it:
 * real time where lag is part of the story (the clear, terminals), the server's ticks where only the
 * fight is (the bosses). Seconds to one decimal, no "s".
 *
 * Nothing here touches Minecraft: the module feeds it the moments the game shows and asks for rows.
 * A row is tab-separated cells, the first being the split's total, for the HUD to lay out as a
 * table. A cell that is not known is left empty so the columns after it stay in line.
 *
 * Each sub split is the time since the one before it (the first, since the split started), except
 * where noted.
