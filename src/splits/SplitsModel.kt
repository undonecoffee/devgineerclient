/**
 * The run's splits, in the Engineer Splits format: the same eleven lines, names, colours, order
 * and format.
 *
 *     Pace       &3   everything so far
 *     Open       &a   run start -> the Watcher's first line (the blood rush)
 *     Blood      &c   the Watcher's first line -> "You have proven yourself" (the camp)
 *     Portal     &d   -> Maxor's first line
 *     Enter      &9   Open + Blood + Portal
 *     Maxor      &5   -> Storm's first line
 *     Storm      &b   -> Goldor's first line
 *     Terms      &6   -> "The Core entrance is opening!"
 *     Goldor     &e   -> Necron's first line
 *     Necron     &c   -> EXTRA STATS. Since Hypixel's boss update (Oct 2026) there is no end
 *                        animation to split off: his death goes straight into the run's end.
 *
 * A split only appears once it has started, rather than as a blank line, and Pace here is the
 * run's running total, with no PB targets behind it.
 *
 * Nothing here touches Minecraft, so it tests headlessly: feed it chat lines with the clock
 * readings they arrived at, then ask for the lines.
