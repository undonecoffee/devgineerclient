/**
 * Storm armor's Witherborn: a full set summons a small wither that flies at nearby enemies and
 * explodes on them - in F7's boss, on the boss. To the client it is a wither like Maxor, so
 * anything looking for "the wither" can take it for him (his death when it explodes, a hit,
 * the wrong boss to aim at).
 *
 * Told apart by where it first appears: on its owner. A Witherborn wither almost always first
 * shows within 3 blocks of a player (always within 4), while the bosses appear at their own
 * spots, nearly always 15+ blocks from anyone and never within 4.8. A boss coming
 * back into view next to someone keeps its entity id, so only an id's first sighting decides.
 * A wither scaled down (a smaller size attribute) counts as one too.
