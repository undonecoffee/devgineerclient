/**
 * Pace and lag for the splits HUD and the scorecard (F7).
 *
 * Pace is the run's projected finish against a target per split: the Pace target box, else the PB
 * for it (OdinSplitsLook.paceTarget), else its dark green time ([SubSplitGrades]' fastest band).
 * Time already proven, plus the target for everything still to come. Proven is every finished
 * split as it was; the one running is its target, moved by what its finished sub splits gained or
 * lost against their share of that target, and by the running sub split once it is past its share.
 * So at load-in Pace is the PBs added up, and from there it moves by exactly the time gained or
 * lost. It is kept on both clocks: real time, and the server's ticks.
 *
 * Lag is the time the server lost against 20 ticks a second on the splits timed in ticks (all but
 * the terminals): their real time minus their ticks x 50 ms.
 *
 * Nothing here touches Minecraft, so it tests headlessly.
