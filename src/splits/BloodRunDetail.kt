/**
 * The blood rush, room by room, rebuilt every frame so the room being run counts up live.
 *
 * A room starts the moment the door into it starts falling and ends when the door out of it
 * starts falling, so the rooms tile end to end. Every time in a room is measured from that room's
 * own start. What a real run looks like (server ticks):
 *
 *     128  [NPC] Mort: Here, I found this map...
 *     131  36 door blocks turn to barrier            <- the start door starts falling: room 1
 *     144  those 36 barriers turn to air             <- it is down; it joins Entrance and Pipes
 *     292  a "Wither Key" armor stand appears        <- the room's last mob died
 *     304  ... has obtained Wither Key!
 *     306  Player opened a WITHER door!              <- room 1 ends, room 2 starts falling in
 *     319  36 barriers turn to air, joining Pipes and Duncan
 *     ...
 *     680  The BLOOD DOOR has been opened!           <- the rush ends
 *
 * The rooms are named from the door itself: each door that comes down sits between two rooms on
 * the dungeon map, one the rush came from and one it is going into. That works whoever is
 * rushing, and it is how the fairy room is spotted — when the door that falls is fairy's own
 * door out, the rush went through fairy, and the room before it is the one that led there.
 *
 * Nothing names the player who killed the last mob: Minecraft has no kill attribution, so that
 * line is timed and never credited.
