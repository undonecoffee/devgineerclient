/**
 * Maxor's energy-crystal cycles, timed from what a client can see (the Alpha server's fight, which
 * the main server has run since Hypixel's boss update, Oct 2026).
 *
 *  - Maxor's phase runs on a 10-tick check. The pylons open on the check 40 ticks before the
 *    beacon goes in; the beacon slot (73, 221-222, 73) is cleared one tick after that check.
 *  - After a laser hit (on a check) the top crystals come back 40 ticks later.
 *  - A placement starts a 28-tick charge, and the laser fires on the first check at least one
 *    tick after the charge ends: both crystals placed by check - 29 make that check.
 *
 * So each cycle is timed from the moment crystals could first be placed - the pylons opening for
 * the first, the crystals coming back for the rest - and says which check the laser was ready for
 * and which it fired on. Ticks are server ticks; free of Minecraft so it tests headlessly.
