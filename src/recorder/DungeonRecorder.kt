/**
 * Dungeon Recorder: everything that happens in a dungeon, losslessly, for building mods with an LLM.
 * Where Better PF records a replay and Boss Recorder the boss fights, this keeps the lot:
 *
 *  - every packet both ways, field by field ([PacketJson]), with every frame's exact bytes and the
 *    connection's lifecycle ([WireTap], [RecorderLifecycle]) and what became of each packet ([PacketFate]);
 *  - the world as the client held it ([ChunkCapture], [WorldCapture]) and every entity every tick
 *    ([EntityMirror], [EntityCapture]);
 *  - the player: input and what it came to ([InputCapture]), the full player state, the camera and the clock
 *    ([PlayerState], [FrameCapture], [EnvOptions]), screens, chat and HUD as drawn ([ScreenCapture],
 *    [HudCapture]), sounds and particles ([EffectsCapture]), opt-in thumbnails ([ThumbCapture]);
 *  - what the mods made of it: Odin's state, events and internals ([OdinState], [OdinEvents],
 *    [OdinInternals]).
 *
 * This object holds the settings and the packet path; each capture unit installs its own hooks and
 * does nothing while no recording is open. Files: <game dir>/devgineerclient-recordings/, one
 * directory per recording: gzipped JSON Lines parts with an index, a raw packet sidecar and a
 * manifest ([RecorderSession], [Rec]).
